//! What ends a daemon's cycle: the next tick, or a signal.
//!
//! Every daemon here is the same shape -- wait, do a pass, repeat until told to
//! stop -- and each of them spelled the same `tokio::select!` over a sleep and
//! three signal handlers.  A copy per daemon is a chance per daemon to get the
//! exit code wrong, and supervisord reads the exit code.
//!
//! It is also the seam that makes a daemon's loop testable at all: with the
//! ticks coming from here, a test can hand a loop three of them and an exit and
//! watch what it writes, instead of the loop being unreachable inside `main`.
