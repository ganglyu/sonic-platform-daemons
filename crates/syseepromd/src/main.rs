//! The daemon is small because the work is not its own: the platform decodes
//! the EEPROM and publishes EEPROM_INFO itself, through
//! `Eeprom.update_eeprom_db()`.  What is left here is a period, an integrity
//! check, and a teardown -- which is exactly what the Python one is too.
//!
//! Republishing is not unconditional.  The table is a cache that `show platform

//! cleared it; the daemon notices that by comparing the key set against the one
//! its own write produced, and only then rewrites.
